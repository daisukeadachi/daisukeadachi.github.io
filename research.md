- Robots and Employment: Evidence from Japan, 1978-2017 (with Daiji Kawaguchi and Yukiko U. Saito). *Revision requested at Journal of Labor Economics*

  We study the impact of industrial robots on employment in Japan, the country with the longest tradition of robot adoption. We obtain a novel data set of robot shipments by destination industry and robot application (specified task) in quantity and unit values. The data show a decreasing trend in robot unit values. Narrative evidence suggests that technological progress drove the decreasing trend. Guided by these findings, we employ an identification strategy leveraging the heterogeneous application of robots across industries and heterogeneous price changes across applications. For example, the automobile industry relies heavily on welding processes while the electric machine industry predominantly requires assembling tasks. Thus, the price drop of welding robots relative to that of assembling robots induces faster adoption of robots in the automobile industry than in the electric machine industry. Our industry-level analysis indicates that a one-percent decline in robot prices increased the number of robot arms by 1.54 percent and total employment by 0.44 percent. These estimates suggest that robots and labor are gross complements at the industry level that aggregates the occupations in each industry. We also show that the result is robust to the robot quality adjustment, where the quality is backed out from the robot demand function. Finally, we compare our estimates with the existing studies and propose a mechanism that explains apparent differences between the results.

- Multinational Production and Labor Share (with Yukiko U. Saito)

  We investigate the impact of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on the labor share in the source country. We propose an equilibrium model that features a production function with factor inputs in foreign countries. Each firm receives a shock that shifts the productivity of foreign factor inputs. We conduct comparative statics regarding the foreign factor productivity shock and show that the difference in factor demand elasticities with respect to foreign factor prices affects aggregate labor share. To identify these elasticities, we develop a method-of-moments estimator that leverages a foreign factor productivity shock. We then apply the estimator to a unique natural experiment: the 2011 Thailand Floods. The floods had a strong impact on manufacturing clusters in areas north of Bangkok city and affected Japanese MNEs by forcing them to halt operations of plants located in the cluster. We employ a unique combined Japanese firm- and plant-level dataset that tracks wages, employment, fixed assets in Japan, and employment in foreign subsidiary plants. The estimated factor demand elasticities indicate that foreign factor augmentation increased capital demand in Japan more than labor demand, suggesting that the foreign factor augmentation contributes to reducing the labor share in Japan.
