<p align="justify">This paper studies the relationship between industrial robots and employment in Japan based on a unique dataset that allows us to calculate the unit price of robots. Our model combines standard factor demand theory with a recent task-based approach to derive a simple estimation equation between robot prices and employment, and our identification strategy leverages heterogeneous applications of robots across industries and heterogeneous price changes across applications. We find that the decline in robot prices increased both the number of robots and employment by raising the productivity and production scale of robot-adopting industries.</p>



### [Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard in Corporate Insurance Markets: Evidence from the 2011 Thailand Floods](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0167268122004371) (with Hiroyuki Nakata, Yasuyuki Sawada, and Kunio Sekiguchi). Forthcoming in the *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*. [Final working paper version](./assets/papers/Thai_insurance 221021.pdf).

<p align="justify">This paper is the first empirical study on adverse selection and moral hazard in the corporate disaster insurance market. By constructing and examining a unique plant-level panel dataset on the 2011 Thailand floods, we overcome the general lack of data that has previously prevented a systematic study on the issue. By exploiting unexpected, large losses caused by a severe disaster, we find evidence of adverse selection for both property and business interruption insurance. Moral hazard, measured by impacts on recovery efforts, is also found for both types of insurance, albeit more salient effects for business interruption insurance.



## Working papers

### [Robots and Wage Polarization: The Effects of Robot Capital across Occupations](./assets/papers/draft_JMP_adachi_latest.pdf). *Job Market Paper.*

Best paper award at the [19th GEP/CEPR Annual Postgraduate Conference](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gep/news-events/conferences/2020-21/postgrad-conference-2021.aspx)

<p align="justify">Robotization has been substituting or complementing workers in a wide range　of occupations. To study the strength of this substitutability and the distributional　impacts of robotization, I match unique data on imported robot prices with the occupational　task information to measure the cost of using robots by occupation. The　data reveal that a 10% cost reduction induces a 1.2% drop in wages of production　and transportation occupations in the US, suggesting strong substitutability.　This　finding motivates the development of a model in which robots are traded and can　substitute labor with different elasticities of substitution across occupations. Using　a model-implied optimal instrumental variable, I estimate higher elasticity of substitution　between robots and workers than that of general capital goods in production　and transportation occupations. These estimates imply that the adoption of industrial　robots significantly affects wage polarization in the US.</p>



### [Multinational Production and Labor Share](./assets/papers/multinational_thaiflood_latest.pdf) (with Yukiko U. Saito).

<p align="justify">We investigate the impact of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on the labor share in the source country. We propose an equilibrium model that features a production function with factor inputs in foreign
countries. Each firm receives a shock that shifts the productivity
of foreign factor inputs. We conduct comparative statics regarding
the foreign factor productivity shock and show that the difference
in factor demand elasticities with respect to foreign factor prices
affects aggregate labor share. To identify these elasticities, we
develop a method-of-moments estimator that leverages a foreign factor
productivity shock. We then apply the estimator to a unique natural
experiment: the 2011 Thailand Floods. The floods had a strong impact
on manufacturing clusters in areas north of Bangkok city and affected
Japanese MNEs by forcing them to halt operations of plants located
in the cluster. We employ a uniquely combined Japanese firm- and plant-level
dataset that tracks wages, employment, fixed assets in Japan, and
employment in foreign subsidiary plants. The estimated factor demand
elasticities indicate that foreign factor augmentation increased capital
demand in Japan more than labor demand, suggesting that the foreign factor augmentation contributes to reducing the labor share in Japan.</p>


### [Commuting Zones in Japan](./assets/papers/commuting_zones_rietidp.pdf) (with Taiyo Fukai, Daiji Kawaguchi, Yukiko U. Saito).

<p align="justify">We construct commuting zones (CZs) in Japan using the inter-municipality commuting patterns observed in the 1980-2015 Population Census. We employ the hierarchical agglomerative clustering method adopted by Tolbert and Sizer (1996), who defined the standard CZs in the US. As a result, for example, in 2015, from 1,736 municipalities, we construct 265 CZs that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. We discuss the properties of economic variables within and across the CZs and find that CZs are feasible to capture the heterogeneity that exists across labor markets.</p>



## Work in progress

### Robots on Sale: The Effect of Investment Promotion on Robot Adoption and Employment (with Daiji Kawaguchi and Yukiko U. Saito).

<p align="justify">We study the role of an investment promotion policy in adopting industrial robots and firm performances, notably employment. Combining the policy variation in the Tax Credit for Promoting Productivity-Enhancing Equipment Investment (TC-PPEI) in Japan and a newly collected Japanese firm-level longitudinal data on robot adoption, we find that the firms eligible for the TC-PPEI increased the adoption of robots. Our event-study analysis reveals that when firms adopt robots, they do not decrease the total number of workers but significantly increase it after 1-3 years of adoption event as well as sales. Our results suggest that adopting robots can be employment creating instead of destroying at the firm level.</p>
