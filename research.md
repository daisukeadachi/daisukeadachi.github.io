- Rails, Risks, and Resilience: A Dynamic Spatial Equilibrium Model with Natural Disaster

<!--

<p align="justify">Local natural disasters can affect the entire spatial economy through direct effects and spillovers, yet this has not been explicitly considered in spatial equilibrium models. This study constructs a dynamic stochastic spatial economic model that explicitly incorporates natural disaster risk and analyzes how the interdependence between aggregate uncertainty and spatial frictions affects labor distribution and welfare. By adopting a formulation where a single Poisson shock representing natural disasters affects both productivity decline and changes in transportation costs, we simplify the dependence of economic variables on disasters and enable analysis of its approximate solution using the master equation approach. We apply the model to Japan's Tokai Trough earthquake risk and the Linear Chuo Shinkansen project to quantify the economic value of transportation infrastructure redundancy under disaster risk. Simulation results show that disaster risk affects short-term and long-term spatial equilibria differently, suggesting that traditional cost-benefit analyses that do not consider disaster risk may misvalue the long-term value of transportation infrastructure. This framework provides policymakers with a new perspective for evaluating transportation infrastructure investments in the presence of natural disaster risk.</p>

- Robots on Sale: The Effect of Investment Promotion on Robot Adoption and Employment. (joint with Daiji Kawaguchi and Yukiko U. Saito).

<!--

<p align="justify">We study the role of an investment promotion policy in adopting industrial robots and firm performances, notably employment. Combining the policy variation in the Tax Credit for Promoting Productivity-Enhancing Equipment Investment (TC-PPEI) in Japan and a newly collected Japanese firm-level longitudinal data on robot adoption, we find that the firms eligible for the TC-PPEI increased the adoption of robots. Our event-study analysis reveals that when firms adopt robots, they do not decrease the total number of workers but significantly increase it after 1-3 years of adoption event as well as sales. Our results suggest that adopting robots can be employment creating instead of destroying at the firm level.</p>

<!--

<p align="justify">This paper studies the relationship between industrial robots and employment in Japan based on a unique dataset that allows us to calculate the unit price of robots. Our model combines standard factor demand theory with a recent task-based approach to derive a simple estimation equation between robot prices and employment, and our identification strategy leverages heterogeneous applications of robots across industries and heterogeneous price changes across applications. We find that the decline in robot prices increased both the number of robots and employment by raising the productivity and production scale of robot-adopting industries.</p>

- [Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard in Corporate Insurance Markets: Evidence from the 2011 Thailand Floods](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S0167268122004371). (with Hiroyuki Nakata, Yasuyuki Sawada, and Kunio Sekiguchi). *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*, 2023, 205, 376-386. [Final working paper version](./assets/papers/Thai_insurance 221021.pdf).

<p align="justify">This paper is the first empirical study on adverse selection and moral hazard in the corporate disaster insurance market. By constructing and examining a unique plant-level panel dataset on the 2011 Thailand floods, we overcome the general lack of data that has previously prevented a systematic study on the issue. By exploiting unexpected, large losses caused by a severe disaster, we find evidence of adverse selection for both property and business interruption insurance. Moral hazard, measured by impacts on recovery efforts, is also found for both types of insurance, albeit more salient effects for business interruption insurance.</p>
